# Ashii-Art Ray-Caster in C++

Ever wondered what Minecraft would look like if it was spheres instead of blocks? And in ashii-art? And way underdeveloped? Me neither, perhaps something like this.

## What is this?
A bare-bone ray-caster, able to render spheres and planes. No use of graphic libraries. This makes this project very suitable for getting comfortable with fundamental computer graphics topics, such as transforms, quaternions, lambertian-lighting, ray-casting and more.

## Features
- **Basic Movement:** User can move in the scene (WASD) and rotate its head left and right (JL). Here, the scene is populated with spheres with noses.

- **Posess gameobjects:** User, switching modality, can move other gameObjects in the scene, and rotate them (same commands).

- Game Objects can be composed of many spheres, enabilng the creation of complex meshes.
