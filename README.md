# Ashii-Art Ray-Caster in C++

Ever wondered what Minecraft would look like if it was spheres instead of blocks? And in ashii-art? And way underdeveloped?

## What is this?
A bare-bone ray-caster, able to render spheres and planes. No use of graphic libraries. This makes this project very suitable for getting comfortable with C++ and fundamental computer graphics topics, such as transforms, quaternions, lambertian-lighting, ray-casting and more.

## Features
User can perform different actions with the buttons **M, N, O** and **P**:
- **M** -> **Basic Movement**: Move in the scene (WASD) and look left and right (JL).
- **N** -> **Move all gameobjects**: Move all gameobjects in the scene (WASD) and rotate them (JL) relative to their local coordinates.
- **O** -> **Move sibgle object**: Move a chosen gameobject in the scene (WASD) and rotate it (JL).
- **P** -> **Possess gameobject**: Move to the position and rotation of a chosen gameobject.

Other features:
- gameobjects can be created with as many spheres and planes as desided.
